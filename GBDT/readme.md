# 1. XGBoost



# 2. CatBoost
## CatBoost is an algorithm for gradient boosting on decision trees. It is developed by Yandex researchers and engineers, and is used for search, recommendation systems, personal assistant, self-driving cars, weather prediction and many other tasks at Yandex and in other companies, including CERN, Cloudflare, Careem taxi. It is in open-source and can be used by anyone.
**Some high-light features:**
- **Great quality without parameter tuning :** Reduce time spent on parameter tuning, because CatBoost provides great results with default parameters.
- **Categorical features support :** Improve your training results with CatBoost that allows you to use non-numeric factors, instead of having to pre-process your data or spend time and effort turning it to numbers.
- **Fast and scalable GPU version :** Train your model on a fast implementation of gradient-boosting algorithm for GPU. Use a multi-card configuration for large datasets.
- **Improved accuracy :** Reduce overfitting when constructing your models with a novel gradient-boosting scheme.
- **Fast prediction :** Apply your trained model quickly and efficiently even to latency-critical tasks using CatBoost's model applier.
